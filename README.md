## TEP Commentary Template
### About
This is a L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X template created for writing the commentaries for the Technik-Ethik-Politik course at TU Graz. Also included are the guidelines for writing the report. Source handling is done via B<sub>IB</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X with Biber as a backend. Simply put your sources into the `sources.bib` file using standard B<sub>IB</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X  format:

```bibtex
@article{example2023,
    author  = {Example, Author},
    title   = {Title of the Article},
    journal = {Journal Name},
    year    = {2023},
    volume  = {42},
    number  = {1},
    pages   = {123-456}
}
```

Then cite them in your text using eg. `\parencite{example2023}`. For further formats beyond articles, please refer to the B<sub>IB</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X [documentation](https://ctan.org/topic/bibtex-doc?lang=en).

The "Leitfaden_Kommentar.pdf" is taken directly and unchanged from the TeachCenter of the course.
